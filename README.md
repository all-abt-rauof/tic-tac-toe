# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java Swing.

## Features
- Graphical user interface using Java Swing components.
- Players can take turns placing their mark (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.
- The game automatically detects winning combinations and declares a winner.
- If all cells are filled without a winner, the game declares a tie.
- Includes a reset button to start a new game.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile the `TicTacToe.java` file using `javac TicTacToe.java`.
3. Run the compiled class file using `java TicTacToe`.

## Instructions
- Player X starts the game.
- Click on an empty cell to place your mark (X or O).
- The game automatically switches turns between players.
- The game ends when one player wins or all cells are filled.

## Dependencies
This project uses:
- Java SE Development Kit (JDK) for compiling and running Java code.
- Java Swing for creating the graphical user interface.

## Future Improvements
- Implement a smarter AI for single-player mode.
- Add a scoreboard to keep track of wins and ties.
- Enhance the visual design of the game interface.
